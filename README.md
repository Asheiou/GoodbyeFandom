# Goodbye Fandom

Goodbye Fandom redirects you to the new location for wikis that have left Fandom, so whenever you land on a Fandom wiki page whether or not by accident, Goodbye Fandom will take you to the better version of the wiki!

## How do I install it?

1. You need a Userscript extension. [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is a good one that supports most modern desktop browsers.
2. [Install Goodbye Fandom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WesternIcelander/GoodbyeFandom/main/GoodbyeFandom.user.js)
3. Enjoy!

## What about on mobile?

- Android: Try [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser) which is an Android web browser that supports Chrome extensions and install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) Chrome extension, then install the extension in step 2 above.
- iPhone/iPad: Try [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) and then download the Userscript in step 2, and then place the userscript in the directory you configured Userscripts to use. Note that the Userscripts app does not automatically install updates for the script, so when newly added wiki redirects get added you will have to manually install an updated version of the script. Userscripts also only works with Safari, and does not work with other browsers.
